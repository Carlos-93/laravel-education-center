# Comprehensive Educational System

This project involves the development of a comprehensive educational system incorporating a simplified CRM, focused on assisting teachers in efficiently managing, controlling, and communicating with their students, as well as in administering courses and evaluations.

## Previous Requirements

Before starting, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Carlos-93/laravel-education-center.git
    ```
2. Change into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd laravel-education-center
    ```
3. Install PHP dependencies:
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```
4. Install NPM packages:
    ```bash
    npm install && npm run dev
    ```
5. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your environment variables:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Make sure to set up your database connection details in the `.env` file.

6. Generate an application key:

    You should now be able to access the application at http://localhost:8000.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.
